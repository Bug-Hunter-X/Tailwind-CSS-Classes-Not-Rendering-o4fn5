The following Tailwind CSS classes are not applied correctly: `bg-gray-200`, `p-4`, `rounded-lg`, `shadow-md`.  I've inspected the element using the browser's developer tools, and these classes appear to be present in the HTML, yet they are not visually rendering.

```html
<div class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  This div should have a light gray background, padding, rounded corners, and a subtle shadow.
</div>
```
