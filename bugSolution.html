The issue was resolved by ensuring that the Tailwind directives were correctly placed within the `style` tag in the HTML file.  A missing `@tailwind` directive or an incorrect path was causing the styles to be missing.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Tailwind CSS Test</title>
<style>
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  This div now has the correct styling.
</div>
</body>
</html>
```
